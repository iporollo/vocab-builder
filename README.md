# Vocab Builder

## Goal

When I'm browsing or reading an article, if I come across a word that I don't know, I want to

1. find it's definition
2. save it for later

I can then take a look at my saved words that I didn't know. I can see the context that it was used in and other example uses of it in a sentence. I would also like to see its definition, synonyms, etc (classic dictionary things).

I would also like a learn the words through spaced repetition. At 8:30pm every night, I want to be reminded that I should practice vocab. Ideally, the reminder would appear and then I would engage in a 10-15 minute spaced repetition practice where I learn vocab words.

## Todos (MVP)

- Chrome extension
- Highlight word -> right click on highlighted word -> button "Save to Vocab Builder" should appear in the dropdown
- On click of "Save to Vocab Builder" button, the chrome extension should save the new word to a list
- If I want to look at all the saved words, I can open the extension and see:

1. The list of words
2. Each word includes the context in which it was encountered
3. Each word includes the definition & example usage

- At 8:30pm, send a popup on chrome to start the spaced repetiton practice
- During spaced repeition, approach is similar to anki cards (although not sure if we type in the answer or simply enter a score in - needs more research)

## Todos (Complete)

- Good design
- Account management
- Scheduling of repetition pop up (not just at 8:30pm)
